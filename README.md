# Oxford Comma List Formatter

## Objectives
* Make a method that takes an array of strings and formats them to be one Oxford comma styled list. For instance, the method should turn the array `["fiddleheads","okra","kohlrabi"]` to the string  `"fiddleheads, okra, and kohlrabi"`.
* This is a test-driven lab so run `rspec` to get started.
